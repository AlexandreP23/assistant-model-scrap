# Project: Intelligent Assistant with Langchain, Groq and Streamlit

This project uses **Langchain**, **Langchain-Groq**, and **LLM (Llama)** to create an intelligent assistant capable of accessing web pages, performing web scraping, and generating intelligent responses based on the scraped data.

## Features

- Web scraping of content from the authenticated page.
- Processing the scraped content using the `Llama-3.1-70b-versatile` model integrated with Langchain-Groq.
- Generation of intelligent responses based on the obtained content.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language.
- **Langchain**: A framework for building applications powered by large language models (LLMs).
- **Langchain-Groq**: An extension for integrating Groq with Langchain for advanced AI functionalities.
- **Llama-3.1-70b-versatile**: The language model used for generating responses.
